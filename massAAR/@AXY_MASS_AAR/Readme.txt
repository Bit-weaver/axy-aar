This readme was taken from the AXY_AAR addon, not the MASS_AAR which is a work in progress.  However, some params apply.

Place the userconfig file into your ArmA3\userconfig\axy_aar\ folder.
Edit that config file to make any changes required, such as the folder to store the AAR files.  (Make sure the game isn't running at the time.)

Play any mission, single player or multiplayer.  Only one person in each group needs to be running the addon.  It's a client side addon, not intended for servers and won't function anyhow.  As you play your mission, you will see a new AAR file being created in the AAR configured directory.

You can view this file in notepad.

After the mission....

The aarShow mission will let you load/view existing aar's.
Open that mission in Single Player and select the load AAR action menu item.
Your action menu will then list all AAR's found.  Select the desired one from the list in the action menu.

That's it.
