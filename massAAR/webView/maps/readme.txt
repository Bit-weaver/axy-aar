Subdirectories to this folder contain your maps, settings for those maps and their tiles.

The tiles subdirectory of each map needs to contain the tiles for the map, in the format of..

.\mapname\tiles\zoomlevel\x\y

There needs to be a settings.js file in the mapname folder, which contains map specific details.

Most important is the full coordinates of the max zoom level map...including blank space.
